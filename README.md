The idea is to make a prediction of train_month_3_with_target.csv by using the data on this file and the target. We can use train_month_1.csv and train_month_2.csv to create new variables, so if we decide to do it, we have to do the same on the test set. At the end we need to upÄºoad the ids and the probability of churn in a csv. Please create a folder named data and put all the csv files in it (or extract the zip in that folder)
